# Udacity Nanodegree Foundation Program

This is the repository of all the projects I will carry out during [Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation Program]("https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101")


## Project 1 -- your first neural network

Using only numpy, we build a neural network from scratch to carry out predictions on daily bike rental ridership.

In this project, you'll get to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, you'll have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before we move to higher level tools such as Tensorflow. You'll also get to see how to apply these networks to solve real prediction problems!
